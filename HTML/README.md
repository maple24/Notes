## what is HTML5?

HTML5 is the latest specification of the HTML language, and represented a major break with previous markup practices. The purpose of the profound changes to the language was to standardize the many new ways in which developers were using it, as well as to encourage a single set of best practices with regards to web development.

Most of the individual changes are a result of larger objectives in the design of the language. These objectives primarily include:

- Encouraging semantic (meaningful) markup
- Separating design from content
- Promoting accessibility and design responsiveness
- Reducing the overlap between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Supporting rich media experiences while eliminating the need for plugins such as Flash or Java

Getting a handle on HTML5 isnâ€™t just about learning which CSS features replace old HTML features. If you want to get an intuitive sense of HTML5, it is best to understand how these objectives affected the development of the language.
